# Mini-Project 3 - COMP 472

This project experiments with word embeddings to solve a Synonym test automatically and compare it with a human standard. Other model comparisons are made, more specifically, models with different corpora and embedding sizes. Different metrics and results are graphed to better understand and analyze the fundamentals of word embedding

## Requirements

The proper functioning of this project requires several installations.
- Python 3.8.3 or equivalent compatibility (using pip or conda)
- pyplot (python library)
- numpy (python library)
- pandas (python library)
- gensin (python library)

## Usage

1. Download the code from [github](https://github.com/George540/comp472_mini_project_3)
2. Open the project in your IDE
3. Run the file **MP3.py** . You will have to wait until all models are processed. Once complete, you will see a graph.

Note: the console will have a loading bar for each model as well
